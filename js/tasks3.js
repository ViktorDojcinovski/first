/**
 *
 * 1. Write a function that for a given string returns the character that repeats the most.
 *
 * Possible solution:
 * Within a function (try not to use global variables):
 * Define and Initialize an object
 * Map character count to that object.
 * Loop through the object to find the max count.
 * Assign new max count value to maxCharCount and new max key to maxChar.
 * Return maxChar
 *
 * Example: countMostOccurances("I am a Codeacademy student.") --> returns "a"
 */

/**
 * 2. Write a function that returns the longest string in an array
 * (with AND withot ES6 syntax - means that you need to provide two solutions)
 *
 * Possible solution:
 * Initialize and Declare Variable for Longest String
 * Loop through the array
 * Find the length of each string
 * Determine if that length is the largest we have seen so far.
 * Replace the longest/largest variable with the arr[index] as long as length is greater than the variable.
 * Return longest/largest string.
 *
 * Example: findLongest("I am a Codeacademy student.") --> returns "Codeacademy"
 */

/**
 * Bonus task
 *
 * 3. Write a function that can receive a string as a parametar that possibly contains three types of braces ({}, [], ()),
 * and returns a Boolean indicating whether the given string contains a valid nesting of braces (valid means, as many closed as opened).
 *
 * Example: isBalanced("function () { console.log()")
